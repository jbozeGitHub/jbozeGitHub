- 👋 Hi, I’m @jbozeGitHub
- 👀 I’m interested in creating a AI trading bot for Ameritrade, FOREX, and Binance.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to be able to automate various trading strategies to help mitigate risk, check news, analyze news, and give me percentage claims of wins.
- So for instance I'd need something that shows pie charts and gauges. For example: 1-10 of a range gauging from do not buy to do buy.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on getting help on making these programs. I'll be sharing these codes, because I believe autonomy of trade could better the headaches of feeling that it is hard
- to percieve trading anything rocket science, because in my humble opinion rocket science is even more approachable.
- 📫 How to reach me through GitHub
- 😄 Pronouns: he/she/they
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am a gardener.
